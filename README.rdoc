== Online Toolbox

The online toolbox is a system designed by Nathan Tornquist to aid in the recruitment process in the band department at Purdue University.

This tool allows for dynamic tracking of student information, and a flexible database structure to store said information.  The core student database is organized by datatype instead of content type, which allows for flexible expansion without rewriting code.

Built with on ruby 2.1.2.
